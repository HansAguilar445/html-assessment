            <dt><b>Excalibur</b>
                <dd>
                    When people talk about legendary weapons, this is usually one of the first weapons to come to mind. The sword of King Arthur, Excalibur, is the most famous weapon from Arthurian legend, 
                    and has many different variations of its origins. Some tellings of the origin of Excalibur claim that it is the famed sword in the stone, only able to be pulled out by the rightful king.
                    Other stories claim that Excalibur was the second sword of King Arthur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake to replace the sword of selection. In any case, it was used up until the Battle 
                    of Camlann. In some versions of the story, Arthur, mortally wounded, requests one of his knights to throw Excalibur into the enchanted lake he received it from. The knight fails twice before 
                    finally returning it, where a hand emerges catch the sword. In the many retellings of the legend of King Arthur, the name of the sword has also changed numerous times. Examples of these different 
                    names are Caledfwlch (from the Welsh versions) and Caliburn (which is often also the sword in the stone). Historically, a weapon identified as Caliburn was found at King Arthur's grave in 1191 and 
                    another sword identified as Excalibur was given to the King of Sicily at the time by King Richard the Lionheart.

            <dt><b>Joyeuse</b>
                <dd>
                    The sword of the King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne, this sword is grounded both in legend and reality. In the legends of Charlemagne's Twelve Paladins, Joyeuse was said to have been forged
                    to contain the Lance of Longinus in its pommel and made of the same materials that Durandal, the sword of Charlemagne's knight Roland, was made of. In the epic poem from the 11th Century named 'The Song of Roland',
                    Joyeuse was said to change its colours at least thirty times a day. In reality, it was a ceremonial sword for French kings' coronations from 1270 to 1824 and was kept in the Treasury of Saint-Denis from at least 
                    1505 before being relocated to the Lourve in 1793.

            <dt><b>Tyrfing</b>
                <dd>
                    Tyrfing is a sword from Norse mythology that is the subject of a literary cycle known as the Tyrfing Cycle. In this literary cycle, the sword was forged when Odin's grandson and king of Gardariki,
                    Svafrlami forced a pair of dwarves to forge a deadly sword that would be able to cut through rock as if it was cloth and would never rust. They did, but they also cursed the sword to kill a man
                    every time it was drawn, to be the cause of three great evils, and to kill its wielder. Svafrlami was furious and attempted to kill them. He failed. Later on, he died and Tyrfing was taken by many
                    other people, with the Three Great Evils being carried out with the violent passing of the sword to some of the users. Eventually, the final user satisfied the dwarves' curses on Tyrfing.
