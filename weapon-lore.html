                When people talk about legendary weapons, this is usually one of the first weapons to come to mind. The sword of King Arthur, Excalibur, is the most famous weapon from Arthurian legend, 
                and has many different variations of its origins. Some tellings of the origin of Excalibur claim that it is the famed sword in the stone, only able to be pulled out by the rightful king.
                Other stories claim that Excalibur was the second sword of King Arthur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake to replace the sword of selection. In any case, it was used up until the Battle 
                of Camlann. In some versions of the story, Arthur, mortally wounded, requests one of his knights to throw Excalibur into the enchanted lake he received it from. The knight fails twice before 
                finally returning it, where a hand emerges catch the sword. In the many retellings of the legend of King Arthur, the name of the sword has also changed numerous times. Examples of these different names are Caledfwlch (from the Welsh versions) and Caliburn (which is often also the sword in the stone).
