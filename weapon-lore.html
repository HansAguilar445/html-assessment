        <h1>Fantasy and Fictional Weapon Lore</h1>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>This page is dedicated to providing information about some of the more famous weapons from literature, legends, and history. Some of these weapons have images related to them from books or other works,
            but some sections might have a picture related to one of the many designs the weapon is given in other works of fiction separate from the original myths if I cannot find an image from a work directly
            related to the myths.

                <dd>
                    When people talk about legendary weapons, this is usually one of the first weapons to come to mind. The sword of King Arthur, Excalibur, is the most famous weapon from Arthurian legend, 
                    and has many different variations of its origins. Some tellings of the origin of Excalibur claim that it is the famed sword in the stone, only able to be pulled out by the rightful king.
                    Other stories claim that Excalibur was the second sword of King Arthur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake to replace the sword of selection. In any case, it was used up until the Battle 
                    of Camlann. In some versions of the story, Arthur, mortally wounded, requests one of his knights to throw Excalibur into the enchanted lake he received it from. The knight fails twice before 
                    finally returning it, where a hand emerges catch the sword. In the many retellings of the legend of King Arthur, the name of the sword has also changed numerous times. Examples of these different 
                    names are Caledfwlch (from the Welsh versions) and Caliburn (which is often also the sword in the stone). Historically, a weapon identified as Caliburn was found at King Arthur's grave in 1191 and 
                    another sword identified as Excalibur was given to the King of Sicily at the time by King Richard the Lionheart.

            <dt><b>Joyeuse</b> </dt>
                <dd>
                    The sword of the King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne, this sword is grounded both in legend and reality. In the legends of Charlemagne's Twelve Paladins, Joyeuse was said to have been forged
                    to contain the Lance of Longinus in its pommel and made of the same materials that Durandal, the sword of Charlemagne's knight Roland, was made of. In the epic poem from the 11th Century named 'The Song of Roland',
                    Joyeuse was said to change its colours at least thirty times a day. In reality, it was a ceremonial sword for French kings' coronations from 1270 to 1824 and was kept in the Treasury of Saint-Denis from at least 
                    1505 before being relocated to the Lourve in 1793.

            <!-- Third section: Tyrfing -->
            <dt><b>Tyrfing</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Tyrfing is a sword from Norse mythology that is the subject of a literary cycle known as the Tyrfing Cycle. In this literary cycle, the sword was forged when Odin's grandson and king of Gardariki,
                    Svafrlami forced a pair of dwarves to forge a deadly sword that would be able to cut through rock as if it was cloth and would never rust. They did, but they also cursed the sword to kill a man
                    every time it was drawn, to be the cause of three great evils, and to kill its wielder. Svafrlami was furious and attempted to kill them. He failed. Later on, he died and Tyrfing was taken by many
                    other people, with the Three Great Evils being carried out with the violent passing of the sword to some of the users. Eventually, the final user satisfied the dwarves' curses on Tyrfing.

            <dt><b>Areadbhar</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Areadbhar, while not one of the most well-known weapons in any form of legends, is an example of a mythical weapon that is a polearm, which is less common than swords in myths. To be specific, it's
                    from Irish mythology as a name for one of Lugh's spears. Lugh was a warrior and a king who possessed multiple weapons, such as this one, a sling-stone, and Fragarach. Areadbhar, in one legend, was said
                    to be a weapon formerly owned by the king of Persia, but Lugh obtained it. It was alive and would decimate enemy ranks on its own, with the only way to quell it being to dip it into a sleeping potion.
                    I could not find any images of Areadbhar's mythological version or anything relevant to the original myth, but many works of fiction such as video games have given Areadbhar some designs.

            <dt><b>Freikugeln</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    This weapon is an unusual addition to this list as it is not like the others. The word Freikugeln refers to the magic bullets from the German legend of the Freeshooter, otherwise known as Der Freisc&uuml;tz. These bullets are special in that
                    they had been enchanted to never miss their target. In the legend and the opera based on the legend, the Freeshooter possessed seven of these bullets thanks to a deal with the devil, and as such, there was a massive downside to the bullets.
                    The first six bullets followed the whims of whoever fired them, but the seventh was at the disposal of the devil. In the opera, the protagonist, Max, was a forester who was trying to get married to his boss' daughter, but he had to win a
                    marksmanship contest in order to prove his worth. He was given the Freikugeln bullets by Kaspar, another competitor in the contest, not knowing their power. Max took four of the bullets and Kaspar kept the other three, trying to get Max 
                    to mess up. On the day of the contest, Max and Kaspar had each used three, leaving only the seventh bullet. Max tries to use the final bullet to win the contest, trying to shoot a bird, but the bullet instead goes for his boss' daughter.
                    Fortunately for Max and his boss' daughter, the bullet is deflected and hits Kaspar instead. The Freikugeln bullets also appeared in other variants of the legend of the Freeshooter.
