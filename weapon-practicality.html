        <h1>Fictional Weapon Practicality (or lack thereof)</h1>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
            This page will detail the issues surrounding many designs for fictional weapons, especially designs from video games. When it comes to designing weapons in fiction,
            people often look to create the coolest designs to appeal to the viewers. While these designs are interesting, they are otherwise critically flawed and as such would
            not be practical in the real world. This is a list of weapons in fiction that, while cool, would never work in reality.

                    The Buster Sword from Final Fantasy 7 is probably one of the best examples of a fictional weapon that would never work in reality. The design is simple: a large
                    blade with a handle that's big enough to grip with two hands. Unfortunately, that isn't enough. The way the sword is designed would make it extremely heavy 
                    without much of a balance, not to mention its unwieldy size. It's essentially a big sharpened brick on a stick, which would be impossible to use properly in real life.
                    The video below shows a recreation of the Buster Sword barely being possible to use.

                    <p>
                        This sword may seem more practical than others, but the way it is used as well as some of its more stylized parts would not be optimal to use the same way that the 
                        games do. The Master Sword is a longsword, which usually is used with both hands. Throughout the Legend of Zelda series, Link uses it with one hand and
                        holds a shield with the other. This would be less optimal in real life compared to using it with both hands or forgoing the use of a shield. Other than that, it's more realistic than lots of other
                        fictional swords are for the most part, as long as you forget about the way Link uses it.

                        While probably not 100% reliable, a user on the Zelda Dungeon forums did an analysis of one version of the sword with some historical evidence and came to the conclusion that it 
                        would be used more effectively if it was smaller or if Link abandoned the shield. After viewing some of their sources, I would agree.

            <dt><b>Monado (Xenoblade Chronicles)</b></dt>

                    <p>
                        The Monado, while less notorious than the Buster Sword, is also probably another striking example of an impractical and unrealistic sword that belongs only in fiction.
                        A professional metalworker and a fencer analysed the Monado, among other swords, for a GamesRadar article, and in the analysis, the fencer pointed out that the design of the sword meant that
                        it needed to have a hard edge and a curvature to slash properly. They also pointed out that the 'ring' in the blade would make it easy to disarm the user, but
                        that would be wrong since that 'ring' is filled with a type of glass that displays symbols when the Monado's power is used. Aside from that inaccuracy, it's pretty
                        clear that the Monado would be quite hard to use realistically given that it's far from as aerodynamic as a normal sword.
